The main goal of this assignment is to practice the formatting and style of a press release. You may have to use some creativity and imagination to fill the content of the press release formatting. Ideally, you will write a press release on behalf of some student organization or group that you are involved in. Or you could write a press release related to your job or a class you are involved in. If none of those spark ideas for you, you could write a press release about a campus event that you attended or that is upcoming. Regardless of what you choose to, you will need to have a clear sense of who \"you\" are as the author of the press release. Are you a member of the group? Are you the organizers of campus event?
